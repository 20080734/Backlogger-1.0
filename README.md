 Simple console app designed to showcase CRUD functionality.
 
 Backlogger is a simple console app that allows you 
 to keep a list of games as your personal Backlog.
 Backlogs in general are lists of games/movies etc ( this 
 app is optimised for games ) that you don't have time to 
 enjoy yet, but you wish to try later. 

 This particular version of Backlogger allows you
 to Create, Read, Update and Delete new or existing 
 games and add them to the backlog. You can also
 search the backlog for existing entries by ID.
